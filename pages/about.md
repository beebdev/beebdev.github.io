# About

Hello world! My name is Elton and I am a final year computer engineering student in Syndey. At this stage of my blog's growing progression, I'm not sure what brought you here.. that incomplete petalinux 2020.1 tutorial guide you are waiting for? Just some typical stalking of who I am? Or you came across my profile somewhere that links to this blogsite? No matter what reason, welcome to beeb.page! I will be keeping track of my tech learning progress and will be posting some tutorial guides on tools or projects I have been working on. Goal of this is to contribute resources and some insight to these topics that I would have found useful when starting and hope you find it useful too!

I am a huge Netflix user (actually, I'm still using my brother's Netflix account just like that movie Parasite) and you would find me bingging on shows outside of work and study.. okay.. sometimes during study. As mentioned in the welcome post, absolute favourites include B99 (NINE NINE!), Rick and Morty (I even have a pickle Rick pillow for binging Netflix in bed), Hospital playlist (s2 out now!).

I enjoying drawing although I haven't drawn in months but last time I drew it was a life drawing course I did in 2020 for my general education course and it was fantastic. Since COVID started I haven't been doing much outdoor activities especially mid-2021 and really do hope travelling will be possible sometime this year.. (who doesn't?)

Overall, I hope you find what you are looking for here and if you wish to follow up on my posts and stories(?) then come visit once in a while! Really do hope I continue this Blog.
