Hello world! Welcome to my first post for the blog. This is where I'll be keeping track of my tech journey. You can expect topics on Embedded Systems, RTOS, FPGA/RTL, Xilinx HLS, and general programming. I may surprisingly be posting about higher-level software development, but currently nothing fancy in mind.

I am a final year university student studying Computer Engineering in Sydney, which may explain why the specific topics to expect listed above. Anyways, have fun looking around and hope it helps out what you are looking for!
