Hello world! Welcome to my first post for the blog. This is where I'll be keeping track of my tech journey. You can expect topics on Embedded Systems, RTOS, FPGA/RTL, Xilinx HLS, and general programming. This site is built with jekyll using the amazing Jekflix template by Thiago Rossener.

Some background about me? I am a final year university student studying Computer Engineering in Sydney, which may explain why the specific topics to expect listed above. I love tech and love learning new technologies that contribute good cause and convenience to our everyday lives. Outside of study or work I binge a lot of shows and movies which is why I'm using this Netflix-like Jekyll template (thanks Thiago). Absolute favourites include B99, Rick and Morty, Hospital Playlist, travellers.... the list goes on tbh.

I have a cat that wakes me up at 4AM everday and love playing with water (Pretty weird huh). Ngl, I always thought I would be more of a dog person and would have a pug that makes noise when breathing but I realised that cats suits the engineer life better as they're more independant.

Anyways, have fun looking around and hope it helps out what you are looking for!
