With new versions of tools every year, it is quite a steep learning slope for new beginners to get into the world of FPGA development. Although there are heaps of awesome resources out there, finding the exact right tutorial with the right version of tools out there is challenging. So, to contribute to the hardware development world I will be writing up a series of tutorials for Xilinx 2020.1 tools, including vivado, vitis, petalinux, and HLS. These steps were the steps I found working during my development and there are definetly other ways that works as well. Without further ado, let get into the first part of the serires: Petalinux 2020.1 Installation.
